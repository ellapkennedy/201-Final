                    <h6>Here is a short writing sample of mine.</h6>
        
                    <p><span class="my_font">Science and history teach an important truth. I discovered this truth this past semester when my Biology professor recommended that we read “The Diversity of Life” by Edward O. Wilson. I bought it, and read it on a plane ride to Florida where I was meeting my family for a weekend trip. From the book, I learned the principles of evolution and related with the scientist’s wonder of the natural world. With new understanding and aged amazement I got off the plane comprehending some of the complexity of the subtropical world around me. We swam with a herd of manatees and I saw that, like the species described in Wilson’s book, the diversity of the manatee, crab, fish, and grass species of the river we swam in were all needed for the ecosystem’s survival. This principle found in science is also true for our social systems.<br>
As I ponder history I realize that it has always been the mixing of cultures that has caused the most growth in society, and the undervaluing of cultures that has caused its greatest losses. In my own life, it is the friendships I have with people from foreign countries that have helped me to grow the most. It was learning that my foreign exchange student friend Olatz worried that her dad would survive the riots that he was apart of during the Catalonia independence movement in Spain that I became passionate about following world news for years to come. Not only did listening to her stories deepen our friendship, but I grew intellectually as well. As a missionary in California I had a friend from every Latin American country. It was hard to appreciate certain aspects of each place until I grew to love the people from them. They provided the context I needed to become a more open minded and compassionate person. I am so passionate about the idea that diversity causes growth because when its celebrated our Earth and our societies grow, but if it is rejected they diminish.</span></p>
